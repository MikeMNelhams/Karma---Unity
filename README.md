# Karma Card Game - 3D

Nothing beats a good old game of cards with some of your closest friends. Now you can play Karma ONLINE with your friends! 

Karma is a constant rollercoaster of emotions, as you shuffle each other's hands, play 20+ card combos in one turn and potentially even bring back winners into the game, to continue their suffering! After all, that's Karma!

Many card games suffer from 2D card interfaces, but this version features 3D interactable cards etc, similar to that of Tabletop Simulator.

The software will be released on Steam for you to play FREE. Release Date TBD. Currently in Alpha.
*(I am developing it so my friends can all play this game together, but online)*

Here is my complete single-player-only CLI version implemented in Python: [Link](https://github.com/MikeMNelhams/Karma)
